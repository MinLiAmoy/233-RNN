The codes train Vanilla, LSTM, GRU RNN models with different rounding methods, including Binarization, Ternarization, Pow2-Ternarization and Exponential Quantization.

regularization.py and round_op.py are forked from ottj/QuantizedRNN. generate_samples.py, theano_funcs.py, utils.py and trian_char_rnn.py are forked from hjweide/lasagne-char-rnn. So is char_rnn.py, with some changes.
